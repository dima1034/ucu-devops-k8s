# Project HW3

## Introduction

This project aims to demonstrate the deployment of a Kubernetes cluster using Terraform and Helm. Please note that for brevity, the `azure` folder containing the Terraform scripts has been omitted. However, it is assumed that the necessary infrastructure has been provisioned using Terraform.

## Deployment

We utilize Helm and Helmfile for managing our Kubernetes deployments. Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes, while Helmfile provides a declarative way to manage multiple Helm releases.
